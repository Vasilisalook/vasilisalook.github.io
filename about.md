## Welcome to my personal E-Portfolio page

### Who is it?

My name is Vasilisa Lukashevich and I am a postgraduate student at The University of Essex. Before the current Artificial Intelligence course I studied Journalism and Linguistics. I work as an editor and interpreter in the News department of a big media group in Beijing, China.

### What is it?

In this E-Portfolio, I would like to show how a person without any coding experience may build an absolutely new way of studying, working and even thinking. 

### How does it work?

I am going to consistently share what I do at the AI programme to grow my skills and develop personally and professionally. I am happy to give all the relevant links to open source guides, videos, websites and GitHub repositories, accompanied by my comments.
