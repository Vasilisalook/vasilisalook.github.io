## Welcome to my personal E-Portfolio page

### My name is Vasilisa Lukashevich and I am a postgraduate student at The University of Essex. Before the current Artificial Intelligence course I studied Journalism and Linguistics. I work as an editor and interpreter in the news department of the big media group in Beijing, China.

### In this e-Portfolio, I would like to show how a person without any coding experience may build an absolutely new way of studying, working and even thinking. 

### I am going to share consistently what I do at the AI programme to grow my skills and develop personally and professionally.
