"Xi Jinping, chairman of the Central Military Commission, signed an order promulgating regulations on international military cooperation. The regulations are of great significance for safeguarding China's sovereignty, security, and development interests, promoting global and regional peace and stability, as well as building a community with a shared future for humanity. With 48 articles in eight chapters, the regulations specify the major tasks and scopes of international military cooperation. The regulations also establish the planning, risk management, safeguard and assessment systems for international cooperation, as well as procedures and methods of organizing such projects. The regulations will go into effect on March 1.",1,0
"Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto and his ideas - better known as Marxism - have a huge influence on the founding of the People's Republic of China and its governing body. Marxist Theory has long been a required course for all universities on the Chinese mainland. Titled Basics of the Fundamental Principles of Marxism, this course covers three main parts: Marxist philosophy (dialectical and practical materialism, etc.), Marxist politics (economics determine politics, how socialism emerged from the world of capitalism and feudalism, etc.), and Marxist economics (the meaning of value and price, how capitalism works, how monopoly emerged from competition, etc.). Opinions on the course are divided among Chinese youngsters, and an increasing number of them are losing interest in it, part of the reason being the theory is far away from their lives. 'The course on Marxist Theory is necessary and important. It not only provides us college students with theoretical basis, but also guides us through practice. I believe two points are important in the theory - one is seeking for the truth, and the other is putting my knowledge into practice,' said Cui Meng, a Marxist major with Minzu University of China. 'But some of my classmates may think it's not quite related to their lives. So ... how do I put it... It's not they don't like the course, but they are just not that passionate about it,' said Adile Ablat with Minzu University of China. Beijing, home to a number of top universities, spend RMB 200 million (31.5 mln US dollars) annually to promote the study of Marxism in colleges. According to a guideline issued in 2015, the Beijing municipal government said it will encourage reforms in Marxist research to build 'socialist universities with Chinese characteristics.' Schools and teachers are encouraged to base the teaching of Marxism more on practices and real-life experiences. In addition, it also promised rewards for high-performing young teachers and professors, and better funding for their projects. 'Marxist Theory, together with other subjects about Chinese politics, account for 10 percent of the total credits for undergraduates; for postgraduates for a master's degree, it's 11 percent; and for doctoral candidates, it's 17 percent,' said Sun Ying, dean of School of Marxism with Minzu University of China. 'On the surface, we do see that not all the students like the course, and some might have some negative feelings about it. But over the past 30 years in my career, [I should say] the course has been conducive to the ideological build-up in Chinese universities and [more importantly] to the country's stability,' added Sun. 'And more students are revisiting Marx's original works, which they find more interesting.'",1,0
"Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has stressed the importance of forging a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation to promote the high-quality development of the Party's work on ethnic affairs in the new era. Xi made the remarks on Friday while presiding over a group study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. Efforts should be made to let people cultivate the awareness that people from all ethnicities are in the same community, where they share weal and woe and stick together through thick and thin, Xi said. Commending the new historic achievements in the Party's work on ethnic affairs since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, Xi said the Party's important thinking on strengthening and improving the work has been formulated, and a new frontier has been opened in adapting Marxist ethnicity theories to the Chinese context and the needs of the times. Noting the new circumstances and tasks in the Party's work on ethnic affairs since the 20th CPC National Congress in 2022, Xi said that no ethnic group shall be left behind in building a great modern socialist country in all respects. A scientific and sound theoretical system for the Chinese national community needs to be established, Xi said, stressing that efforts must be made to integrate Marxist ethnicity theories with China's specific realities and fine traditional culture. Xi urged a focus on building modern Chinese civilization, aiming to lay a solid spiritual and cultural foundation for forging a strong sense of community for the Chinese nation. He stressed strengthening the education of the Party's theories, lines, principles, and policies among people of all ethnic groups, and promoting the creative evolution and innovative development of fine traditional Chinese culture. Comprehensive efforts should be made to promote standard spoken and written Chinese language and the use of unified state-compiled textbooks, he added. Calling for more exchanges and interactions among different ethnic groups, Xi said efforts should be made to promote population mobility and integrated habitation among various ethnic groups, in a bid to continuously foster ethnic unity and progress. He stressed improving people's livelihood and ensuring the benefits of development are delivered fairly to people of all ethnic groups. Xi also called for efforts to better tell the stories of the Chinese nation, and step up public communication regarding the sense of community for the Chinese nation. Party committees and governments at all levels should adhere to the correct and distinctively Chinese approach to handling ethnic affairs, and officials should make their due contributions to ethnic unity and progress, Xi said.",1,0
"The greatest challenge to China-U.S. relations is 'Taiwan independence,' said China's top diplomat Wang Yi on Friday. Wang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks when meeting with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Washington, D.C. 'Taiwan independence' is the most severe threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, which must be resolutely opposed and reflected in concrete policies and actions, Wang told Sullivan. The two sides have agreed to work towards setting up a meeting between the two countries' leaders in San Francisco and conducted substantive and constructive strategic communication on bilateral relations, high-level exchanges and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and other international and regional issues of common concern. Wang, also director of the Office of the CPC Foreign Affairs Commission, is on a three-day visit to the U.S., starting from October 26, during which he has also met U.S. President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.",1,0
"The Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, started its sixth session Friday in Beijing. Zhao Leji, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over the session's first plenary meeting. Lawmakers reviewed a draft revision to the Marine Environment Protection Law submitted to the session for its third reading by the NPC Constitution and Law Committee. The latest draft highlights coordinated efforts to monitor the marine environment and strengthen pollution control while boosting the protection of marine biodiversity. They deliberated a draft law on patriotic education, which was submitted for its second reading. The draft adds provisions that patriotic education should promote the inheritance and development of fine traditional Chinese culture, help the people build up cultural confidence, and make them more capable of building a modern Chinese civilization. Lawmakers also deliberated draft laws on food security and tariffs and a draft amendment to the Charity Law. They reviewed draft revisions to the State Council Organic Law, the Law on Guarding State Secrets, the Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, and the Law on Protection of Cultural Relics. The session also reviewed a raft of bills, including one on an extradition treaty with Mauritius and another on personnel appointments and removals.",1,0
"Wang Yi, re-appointed as China's foreign minister to replace Qin Gang, will be a familiar face to many on the international stage. The 69-year old is already China's top diplomat as head of the Communist Party's Central Foreign Affairs Commission. Unlike in many countries, China's foreign minister is not the most authoritative voice in its diplomatic affairs. Other individuals in the Chinese Communist Party's leadership, including the director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission - a post that Mr Wang continues to hold - have more say over foreign policy formulation. He now returns to a post he held for most of the past decade. One of the leading 'wolf warrior' diplomats - who often engage in combative rhetoric against those who cross Beijing - Mr Wang is well-known to the US. In a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in June, he said Washington's 'misperceptions toward China' has led to misguided China policies. 'China-US relations have gone through ups and downs, and it is necessary for the United States to reflect upon itself, and work with China to jointly manage differences and avoid strategic surprises,' he said. Mr Wang majored in Japanese as an undergraduate at Beijing International Studies University and first joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the age of 29. From 2004 to 2007, he served as China's ambassador in Tokyo. He then moved on to lead China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office from 2008, until he was appointed foreign minister for the first time in 2013. In 2020, he reacted strongly to Czech senate president Milos Vystrcil's visit to Taiwan, warning that the Chinese government would make the Czechs 'pay a heavy price for their short-sighted behaviour and political opportunism'. This prompted Prague to hit back, describing Chinese leaders as 'unmannered rude clowns'. However some observers see Mr Wang's re-appointment as a move to stabilise Chinese diplomacy in a turbulent time - the country's economy is faltering as it emerges from Covid-induced isolation and it's engaged with the US in trying to thaw frosty relations. 'With a series of major international meetings coming up, Xi defaulted to someone who has relationships with many of his foreign counterparts. In times of uncertainty, China wants continuity and predictability in this position,' said Rorry Daniels, a senior fellow at the Center for China Analysis. Ian Johnson, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, added: 'Wang Yi has held the [foreign minister] position before. He's clearly a fireman or caretaker who has been sent in to right the ship to keep Chinese foreign policy going smoothly.' 'And I think he'll do that because he's a very, very capable official,' he said.",0,0
"China's close ties with Russia in countering American dominance point to a geopolitical rift that could shape the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The leaders of China and Russia hailed each other as 'old' and 'dear' friends. They took swipes at the United States and depicted themselves as building a 'fairer, multipolar world.' And they marveled at their countries' 'deepening' trust. China's top leader, Xi Jinping, used a Beijing-led conference of leaders from mostly developing countries on Wednesday to showcase his ambitions to reshape the global order, as the world grapples with a war in Ukraine and a crisis in Gaza. He cast his country as an alternative to the leadership of the United States. And he gave a prominent role to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, underscoring how central their relationship is to Mr. Xi's vision. The event, the Belt and Road Forum, is centered on China's signature foreign policy initiative, which aims to expand Beijing's influence abroad with infrastructure projects. Mr. Putin was treated as the guest of honor and often pictured by Mr. Xi's side. The two leaders also met for three hours in Beijing on Wednesday. While Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi huddled, President Biden landed in Israel on a visit aimed at preventing the war between Israel and Hamas from spreading. Though Mr. Xi did not publicly remark on the war, Mr. Putin, at a news briefing, blamed the United States for increasing tensions in the Middle East by sending warships to the region. He said that such regional conflicts were 'shared threats that only strengthen Russo-Chinese relations.' In Mr. Putin, Mr. Xi has a like-minded partner driven by shared grievances toward the West who is willing to push back against what they both perceive as American hegemony. Mr. Xi sought to tout China as a force for stability in the world, with Mr. Putin alongside him  never mind that Russia upended European security when he launched an invasion of Ukraine 21 months ago. 'Ideological confrontation, geopolitical rivalry and bloc politics are not a choice for us,' Mr. Xi said in a speech at the opening of the forum at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. 'What we stand against are unilateral sanctions, economic coercion and decoupling and supply chain disruption,' Mr. Xi said, clearly referring to efforts by the United States and its Western allies to pressure China. Washington and Beijing are engaged in an intense rivalry over trade, technology and the status of Taiwan, and China has protested bans imposed by the United States on exports of semiconductors to China.",0,0
"At the onset of his unprecedented third term, Xi Jinping stacked China's top ranks with a slate of loyalists who he presumably hoped would smooth the paths to achieve his grand vision for China. Less than a year on, however, a storm of turbulence is roiling Xi's hand-picked ruling elite, raising questions about his judgment and dampening international confidence in his governance - at a time when China is facing major economic troubles at home and increased competition with the United States on the world stage. In just a matter of months, two senior members of China's cabinet who served as the country's key interlocutors with the world have gone missing. Defense Minister Li Shangfu has not been seen in public for three weeks, sparking speculation he is under investigation. Weeks earlier, Foreign Minister Qin Gang was dramatically ousted after vanishing from public view for a month. Their sudden absence comes as Xi is seeking to eliminate any perceived threats and vulnerabilities in a drive to bolster national security, amid rising tensions with the West. Both Li and Qin serve among China's five state councillors, a senior position in the cabinet that outranks a regular minister. Li also sits on the Central Military Commission, a powerful body headed by Xi that commands the armed forces. Meanwhile, the surprise removal of two top generals has rocked the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, an elite unit set up by Xi to modernize China's conventional and nuclear missile capabilities, sparking concerns of a broader purge in the military. The Chinese government, which has become even more opaque under Xi, offered little in the way of a public explanation for the series of personnel shake-ups, nor did it show any interest in clearing up the inevitable speculation that has run rampant since. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qin was found by a Communist Party investigation to have been engaged in an extramarital affair while serving as China's envoy to Washington, citing people familiar with the matter. China's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the report. The lack of transparency over the fate of two high-profile ministers has dealt a blow to the international image of Beijing, which has touted its political model as more stable and efficient than Western democracies. Experts say the growing uncertainty among China's ruling elite has exposed the vulnerabilities of its one-party system - which have only been amplified by Xi's concentration of personal power during what is now his third term. 'What's going on in China really represents and has reflected an absolutely tremendous political risk emanating from Beijing,' said Drew Thompson, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore. 'The political risk is both among Xi Jinping and his relationship with his handpicked subordinates, but also the lack of established rules and norms that govern behaviors in the system.' As defense minister, a largely ceremonial role in the Chinese system, Li does not command combat forces. But he is an important face of China's military diplomacy to the outside world, said James Char, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. 'If Li Shangfu is really in trouble, Beijing will be perceived in a very negative way to have two state councillors removed so soon in Xi Jinping's third term,' he said. Since being promoted to the post in March, Li has traveled twice to Moscow to meet his Russian counterpart, visited Belarus' president in Minsk, and shook hands with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at a security conference in Singapore. In recent weeks, however, Li has reportedly missed a series of diplomatic engagements, including an annual meeting on border defense with Vietnamese officials and a meeting with Singapore's Navy Chief in Beijing. But experts noted there is one silver-lining in Li's mysterious absence when it comes to efforts to stabilize US-China relations. Li was sanctioned by the US in 2018 over China's purchase of Russian weapons, and Beijing has repeatedly suggested that the US won't get a meeting with Li unless the sanctions were revoked. If Li was removed as defense minister, it could potentially open a window for the resumption of high-level military talks between the two superpowers.",0,0
"A trained economist, Li was once tipped to be the country's future leader. But he saw his influence wane as Xi Jingping centralised power in his own hands. Li died on Friday of a heart attack. He was 68.",0,0
"A Chinese fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea on Tuesday, according to the US military. The Chinese pilot 'flew in an unsafe and unprofessional manner, demonstrated poor airmanship by closing with uncontrolled excessive speed, flying below, in front of, and within 10 feet of the B-52, putting both aircraft in danger of collision,' US Indo-Pacific Command said in a Thursday statement. 'We are concerned this pilot was unaware of how close he came to causing a collision.' News of the latest Chinese intercept comes as President Joe Biden is expected to speak with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi when he visits the White House on Friday, CNN reported on Thursday. It is not clear whether the meeting will be a formal discussion or a more informal meet and greet. Wang is also expected to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday and national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Friday. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping may also meet on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in San Francisco next month, though neither side has confirmed finalized plans. The US and China on Thursday both released footage accusing each other of provocative maneuvers in and around the South China Sea, escalating tensions over the disputed waterway. China’s Defense Ministry released a video during a regular press briefing, saying the USS Ralph Johnson 'conducted close-in harassment' against a Chinese navy task group doing routine training in the South China Sea on August 19. Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said the video 'shows that the US side is the real provoker, risk-taker and disrupter.' Wu said the US warship’s actions 'endanger China’s national security' and added China would 'take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty. 'US fighter jets coming all the way to flex their muscles at our doorstep is the root cause of aviation and maritime safety risks,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in response to a question for comment on the incident during a regular briefing on Friday. The Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said earlier this month that the US has seen more instances of 'coercive and risky' behavior from Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that. 'Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,' Ratner said. 'It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.' The Pentagon’s efforts this year to engage with Chinese military leadership have gone unanswered, and US officials have grown increasingly concerned about the lack of military-to-military dialogue between the countries. Beijing cut off the communications after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year, infuriating Chinese leaders. 'I’ve asked to speak with my counterparts, the eastern and southern theater commanders now, going on two and a half years,' INDOPACOM commander Adm. John Aquilino said earlier this month. 'I have yet to have one of those requests accepted.' As part of the latest National Defense Strategy, the US has pointed to China as the 'pacing challenge', capable of competing with America in terms of its military might, economic power and international reach. Beijing already possesses a standing army of more than one million soldiers, the largest navy in the world by number of ships and the largest air force in the region. Beijing claims 'indisputable sovereignty' over almost all of the South China Sea, and uses its military might to assert its claims of sovereignty in the disputed waters and beyond, including Taiwan. In 2022, the Chinese military increased its aggressive actions towards the island, including ballistic missile overflights, military aircraft flying into Taiwan’s aerial identification zone and major exercises near Taiwan. Though Xi has said he is seeking the peaceful unification of Taiwan with China, he has not renounced the use of military force to achieve his goal.",0,0
