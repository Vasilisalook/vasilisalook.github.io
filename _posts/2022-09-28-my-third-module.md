## Summary of the Machine Learning module

On this page I collected notes on my humble progress during the ML module.

## Unit 1. Start with mistake

The ML module starts with the collaborative discussion on the 4th Industrial Revolution. As the tutor noticed (Qazi, 2022), I wrote a text slightly away thematically from the given topic on the failures of an information system, moving forward to the issue of property law in AI, which is closer to the topic of second discussion in the module. In this module I realized that any autonomous machine always starts from the point where it was wrong. And in some fields, it is still hard to develop the ideal system. For example, the most common pitfalls in AI in genomics are distributional differences, dependent examples, leaky preprocessing, unbalanced classes etc., researchers complain that predictive models are not accurate. That potentially chips away the credibility of ML in biomedical research (Whalen at el., 2022). ML facial recognizing systems still make an inappropriate percentage of errors, dealing with different human skin type and gender (Wall, 2019).

## Unit 2. Shine like Heat Map

After diving into the tutorial on Exploratory Data Analysis I can better understand the importance of Heat Maps. At first glance some kinds of correlations look very obvious, for instance, in the case with House Price Kaggle Competition ‘GrLivArea’, ‘OverallQual’, are strongly connected with ‘SalePrice’. It would be surprising if they are not. However, the program is able to count and compare the level of correlations, and it is fantastic. For ‘YearBuilt’ we may see a relatively weak correlation with 'SalePrice', and it is something new for me. It leads to more explorations. You are welcome to find my attempts in the end of the [code here.](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/ML/blob/main/Unit2MLHeatMaps.ipynb)

## Guide for poets

I have put together [a Midjourney based simple guide](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/AI-Illustration%20for%20Poets.pdf) to help poets become painters with AI even if they have never heard about Machine Learning. Because the first step is hard one. <br>
