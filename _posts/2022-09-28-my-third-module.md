## Summary of the Machine Learning module

On this page I collected notes about my progress during the Machine Learning module.

## Unit 1. Start from mistake

The ML module starts with the collaborative discussion on the 4th Industrial Revolution. As the tutor noticed (Qazi, 2022), I wrote a text slightly away thematically from the given topic on the failures of an information system, moving forward to the issue of property law in AI, which is closer to the topic of second discussion in the module. In this module I realized that any autonomous machine always starts from the point where it was wrong. And in some fields, it is still hard to develop the ideal system. For example, the most common pitfalls in AI in genomics are distributional differences, dependent examples, leaky preprocessing, unbalanced classes etc., researchers complain that predictive models are not accurate. That potentially chips away the credibility of ML in biomedical research (Whalen at el., 2022). ML facial recognizing systems still make an inappropriate percentage of errors, dealing with different human skin type and gender (Wall, 2019).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93581837/206925784-a046202f-5914-4138-9843-72490d69a49f.png)

## Guide for poets

I have put together [a Midjourney based simple guide](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/AI-Illustration%20for%20Poets.pdf) to help poets become painters with AI even if they have never heard about Machine Learning. Because the first step is hard one. <br>
