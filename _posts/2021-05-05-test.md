## Trump news – live: Truth Social SPAC agrees to SEC settlement as Trump’s past comments on indictment resurface

All the latest developments from the 2024 campaign trail as the former president’s legal troubles build

The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which has agreed to acquire Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform and take it public has reached a tentative settlement to pay $18m to the SEC.

Digital World Acquisition Corp announced on Monday that it had agreed to pay the penalty and revise some regulatory filings to settle the probe into the planned merger with Truth Social’s parent company.


The SEC has been investigating whether merger talks were held between the two parties before the IPO process.

Meanwhile, Mr Trump’s past comments about a president being criminally indicted have come back to haunt him.

In 2016, Mr Trump said his then-rival Hillary Clinton could soon be charged and that, if she was president, it would “grind government to a halt”.

Ms Clinton has never been criminally charged while Mr Trump is now facing both federal and state trials from two separate investigations – one for his handling of classified documents and the other for falsifying business records.

On the former, Trump administration press secretary Stephanie Grisham has spoken out to claim that she saw Mr Trump showing off documents to guests at Mar-a-Lago, as she slammed his lack of respect for the nation’s secrets.
