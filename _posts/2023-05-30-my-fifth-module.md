## Summary of the Intelligent Agents module

On this page I collected notes on my humble progress during the module...

## Unit 1. Dark sides of agent-based systems

**Summary Post for the discussion** <br> 

We had a remarkable discussion with fellow students on the topic of Intelligent Agents in social media. During our conversation about agent-based systems like chatbots, sentiment analysis, and recommender systems, we also delved into the darker side of their development. These tools, while assisting companies in staying competitive by enhancing user engagement and satisfaction through the analysis of user behavior, can also manipulate users. 

Intelligent Agents on social media, striving to keep users constantly scrolling, have caused problems such as information overload, doom-scrolling, shortened attention spans, sexualization of kids, polarization, and the spread of fake news.

Alberto Castro (Castro, 2023) highlighted that recommender systems still have room for improvement, particularly in sensitive areas like data privacy. He provided an example of "bad" targeting, where a customer discovered about his young daughter's pregnancy through targeted ads.<br> 
Our discussion also touched on bias within recommender systems, which can lead to discrimination against certain user groups and the creation of prejudicial filter bubbles.

At the conclusion of our conversation, Anastasia Rizzo (Rizzo, 2023) posed thought-provoking questions. For instance, how can we strike a balance between the benefits of these agents and user safety and autonomy? What measures can companies and developers implement to mitigate the negative impacts and foster responsible AI deployment?

And in the end, I have got a nice list of useful and actual [references](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/IA_Unit1_References.txt) on the topic above. 

## Unit 2. FOL for linguists

As a linguist, I have devised a primitive visual scheme for transforming sentences from English natural language to First-order language in order to grasp the main idea on my own. **First-order logic** offers greater expressive power than **Propositional logic**, which is also utilized in the field of computing. I find it fascinating and intellectually stimulating to interpret information from "English human" format to "English computer" format. I believe this is of great importance because individuals can be represented as agents in systems too.

Understanding the fundamental terms and rules of this logic is crucial. For example, a **predicate** is a component of a sentence that contains a verb or makes a statement about the subject (where the **subject** is an **attribute** represented as a piece of information enclosed in brackets in computing).

I consider this point to be where programming becomes a highly creative process. To write a sentence like *"It is rained"* as *weather(X, rain)*, one needs to exercise creativity. Another intriguing observation is that pronouns such as *I, it, you, he*, and *she* can be regarded as variables in natural language. My insight is a human language itself is a program, however a highly layered and sophisticated one.
