## Summary of the Intelligent Agents module

On this page I collected notes on my humble progress during the module...

## Unit 1. Dark sides of agent-based systems in social media

**Summary Post for the discussion** <br> 

We had a remarkable discussion with fellow students on the topic of Intelligent Agents in social media. <br> 
During our conversation about agent-based systems like chatbots, sentiment analysis, and recommender systems, <br> 
we also delved into the darker side of their development. <br> 
These tools, while assisting companies in staying competitive by enhancing user engagement and satisfaction <br> 
through the analysis of user behavior, can also manipulate users. 
Intelligent Agents on social media, striving to keep users constantly scrolling, <br> 
have caused problems such as information overload, doom-scrolling, <br> 
shortened attention spans, sexualization of kids, polarization, and the spread of fake news. <br> 
Alberto Castro (Castro, 2023) highlighted that recommender systems still have room for improvement, <br> 
particularly in sensitive areas like data privacy. <br> 
He provided an example of "bad" targeting, where a customer discovered about his young daughter's pregnancy through targeted ads.<br> 
Our discussion also touched on bias within recommender systems, <br> 
which can lead to discrimination against certain user groups and the creation of prejudicial filter bubbles.
At the conclusion of our conversation, Anastasia Rizzo (Rizzo, 2023) posed thought-provoking questions. <br> 
For instance, how can we strike a balance between the benefits of these agents and user safety and autonomy? <br> 
What measures can companies and developers implement to mitigate the negative impacts and foster responsible AI deployment?
And in the end, I have got a nice list of useful and actual [references](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/IA_Unit1_References.txt) on the topic above.
