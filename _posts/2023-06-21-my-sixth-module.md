## Summary of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module

On this page I collected notes on my humble progress during the module...

## Unit 1. Starting Ethically

During the first week of this module, the topic of ethics in the field of computing was suggested for discussion. <br>

**The task:** *Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues.*<br>

As a result, I have prepared a research paper that is just under 1000 words in length. It provides comprehensive information and includes a list of references for further reading. <br>

## Unit 2. Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct

**Summary Post for the discussion**

We had an engaging discussion with fellow students on the topic of the ethics code, based on an illustrative case from the Association of Computing Machinery website: “Automated Active Response Weaponry”. 

In this particular case, a company violated several rules of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For instance, developers ignored Principle 1.2 (avoid harm), Principle 1.1 (contribute to society and human well-being), Principle 1.6 (respect privacy),and Principle 1.4 (do not discriminate). 

Furthermore, the engineers of this company acted correctly by resigning and publicly expressing their awareness, despite breaking their confidentiality agreements. This action aligns with Principle 1.7 (honour confidentiality), Principle 2.5 (provide comprehensive evaluations of potential risks), and Principle 3.1 (ensure that the public good is of central concern).

It is evident that there are also clear violations of the British Computer Society Code of Conduct. The company failed to uphold public interest with regards to public health, privacy, security, and well-being, as well as the promotion of equal access to the benefits of IT.

Nils Linhoff (Linhoff, 2023) emphasised that this post raises significant questions about the role of military AI startups in today's business environment.

Constantinos Kyriacou (Kyriacou, 2023) pointed out that humanity must take full responsibility for our behaviour and always ensure that our actions do not exceed predetermined limits.

In conclusion, I have not come across recent information from scholars regarding ethical issues in the use of AI in the military. The most recent studies on this sensitive topic were published two to three years ago. For example, "How viable is international arms control for military artificial intelligence? Three lessons from nuclear weapons" (Maas, 2019). However, I believe this theme remains relevant, and scholars should raise more questions about it in the context of ethics.<br>

## Unit 3. Research Methods

**Comparing two papers in a Computing field**

This unit helped me to better understand research design and methodology for a specific study. I have compared two papers in the field of Computing to enhance my proficiency in delivering a critical review of existing literature.
I put a separate [post](https://vasilisalook.github.io/practice/2023/05/17/comparing-two-papers.html) about it, you are welcome to click and read. 

## Unit 4. Delving into the data collection methods

In this [Case Study - Privacy](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/Privacy.docx) exercise, I have mentioned the fundamental principles of research ethics, such as data protection, participants' confidentiality, and the responsibility for ensuring that third parties also uphold confidentiality. As a journalist, I am well aware of how frequently these principles are violated. However, I believe that reputable research institutions must prioritise safeguarding their reputation.

## Unit 5. Survey Methods
![Retracted stamp](/assets/images/banners/retracted.png) <br>

In this unit, I independently conducted a small research on the inappropriate use of surveys, ranging from the Cambridge Analytica story to the retracted publication of Wakefield in The Lancet. This work sheds light on the crisis within the scientific community and emphasises the importance of critical thinking. You are welcome to read [my brief analysis on the topic.](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/surveys.docx)

## Unit 6. Survey and Questionnaire Design

Research is not always what it seems. I became aware of this through stories related to marketing from a friend of mine, who explained to me the attitude-behavior gap in consumerism many years ago. For instance, in surveys and questionaries, consumers state their preference for buying a yellow or pink coat this autumn, but in reality, they often end up purchasing a grey or black one. Therefore, the actual purchase actions can reveal more about the real priorities and needs of consumers.
I suppose, in the modern world, this gap problem seems very relevant. Against the backdrop of climate change and the need to reshape our consumer habits, according to surveys, people may willingly embrace "green" consumer behaviour, voluntarily giving up fuel vehicles in favour of electric transport. However, in practice, we discover discrepancy between green attitudes and behaviour (Johnstone & Tan, 2015).
(Boulstridge & Carrigan, 2000) have firstly described this gap from the perspective of consumer purchase behavior in relation to corporate reputation. However, I began to question the reliability of the research format itself.
Furthermore, in addition to the main issues of misunderstandings in questionnaires, such as ignoring the instructions and incorrect interpretations of the questions described by Hardy & Ford (2014), we can also consider the influence of social desirability bias. To put it simply, social desirability bias is when people tend to respond in a way that they believe is socially acceptable or desirable, rather than providing completely honest answers.
Another problem with surveys and questionnaires could be leading questions or even an overall leading design. Let's consider an example with closed questions.

![T-House survey](/assets/images/banners/T-House%20survey.jpeg)<br>

In the illustration Chinese think tank has created a survey regarding attitudes towards the U.S. Government's "China Initiative Project" and "Chips Act." Participants are asked to indicate their agreement or disagreement with the following statements (the spelling and punctuation match the original):
“- It is antithetical to the core values of the scientific community
- Warning of threat from Chinese academics is a delusion
- It seriously undermines academic openness and international cooperation
- It violates the principles of free trade and open markets
- It is a misbehaviour in great power competition
- It is pursuing hegemonism”.
I believe that this is an example of an extremely manipulative type of survey, both in terms of its format (lack of options to disagree) and the questions employed (one-sided, unethical, and provocative). 
We can observe that this example utilised the nine steps involved in the development of a questionnaire, including deciding the required information, defining the target respondents, etc. (Outram, 2023).
I think the form of the questions highly inappropriate. If we would like to improve this survey, firstly we should add the option to disagree, or even further, to add a pair to every question with the opposite opinion (from U.S. perspective). 
However, considering that such surveys are primarily published on platforms controlled by the Chinese government and mainly involve viewers and readers of those media outlets, it is unlikely that the results of such a survey can be taken seriously.
And here we have smoothly transitioned to the issue of selection bias in internet surveys. According to Greenacre (2016), undercoverage, nonparticipation, and selection are among the primary issues contributing to the problems encountered in internet surveys.
Thus, research is not always what it seems due to various factors that can influence the outcomes, including the questionnaire format. The way questions are designed and presented in a questionnaire can significantly impact the obtained responses, and the selection of respondents for the questionnaire can introduce bias.

## Unit 7. My first fail

![Epic Fail](/assets/images/banners/failed.jpg)

For the first time during my studying process at the University of Essex, I failed an assignment. This occurred in this specific module where I had chosen the topic for the Literature Review: "Implementing Deep Learning tools and techniques to detect political misinformation on social media platforms." [Here is the outline paper containing the initial plan.](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/Literature%20Review%20Outline.docx)

The tutor provided positive feedback for the outline, emphasising the need to focus on a critical 'pros and cons' discussion with academic value, supported by citations throughout the Literature Review content.

From the outset, I recognised the necessity of reviewing a substantial amount of information sources in order to produce a profound and meaningful secondary research. I studied over 20 papers covering diverse topics, ranging from the meaning of propaganda and political misinformation to the accuracy of Geometric Deep Learning and practical examples of implementing AI tools.

However, I overlooked a very important aspect of academic writing. In certain explanations, I unintentionally included parts of sentences from related sources without proper citation. Although I mentioned all these papers in the reference list, it became apparent that this approach was highly inappropriate. The Turnitin software flagged 30% of the text as non-original, even though, in the Literature Review format, this indicator should ideally be between 0% and 10% (despite the fact that Academic integrity only accounts for 10% of the overall grade). Due to the lack of my own academic voice in writing, I failed to meet one of the most crucial criteria - Knowledge and understanding (30% of the overall grade).

According to tutors, another issue with my review is its predominantly descriptive nature, lacking critical analysis. I am advised to incorporate more pros and cons into the discussion, not solely relying on comparing model results, but also expressing my own perspective on the primary issue highlighted in the topic.

**Discussion Topic - Case Study: Accuracy of information**

Another discussion on ethical concerns surrounding data analysis has taken place. In the given scenario, Abi encounters several ethical dilemmas regarding the analysis and reporting of the nutritional value of the cereal, Whizzz. On one hand, the answer to Abi's case is obvious - it is unacceptable to falsify research results, particularly if they are unfavourable to the product manufacturer. However, in the real world, we are confronted with a complex framework of the details and conditions, ranging from the country where the study was conducted to the methods employed and the definition of "harm to consumer health." Please feel free to [read my summary post on the discussion here.](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/Accuracy%20of%20information%20Summary.docx)

## Unit 8-9. Statistics Worksheets

## Unit 10
**Questionnaires**
Find a questionnaire and critique the design, both the format and the questions used.
Consider areas such as ‘why is this question included?’, ‘is the form of the question appropriate?’ etc. How can you improve the questionnaire?  Put your analysis in the module wiki and comment on others’ analyses.
