## Summary of the Research Methods and Professional Practice module

On this page I collected notes on my humble progress during the module...

## Unit 1. Starting Ethically

During the first week of this module, the topic of ethics in the field of computing was suggested for discussion. <br>

**The task:** *Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues.*<br>

As a result, I have prepared a research paper that is just under 1000 words in length. It provides comprehensive information and includes a list of references for further reading. <br>

## Unit 2. Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct

**Summary Post for the discussion**

We had an engaging discussion with fellow students on the topic of the ethics code, <br> 
based on an illustrative case from the Association of Computing Machinery website: <br> 
“Automated Active Response Weaponry”. In this particular case, a company violated several rules <br> 
of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. For instance, developers ignored Principle 1.2 (avoid harm), <br> 
Principle 1.1 (contribute to society and human well-being), Principle 1.6 (respect privacy), <br> 
and Principle 1.4 (do not discriminate). Furthermore, the engineers of this company acted correctly <br> 
by resigning and publicly expressing their awareness, despite breaking their confidentiality agreements. 
<br> This action aligns with Principle 1.7 (honour confidentiality), Principle 2.5 (provide comprehensive evaluations of potential risks), and Principle 3.1 (ensure that the public good is of central concern).

It is evident that there are also clear violations of the British Computer Society Code of Conduct. <br> 
The company failed to uphold public interest with regards to public health, privacy, security, and well-being,<br> 
as well as the promotion of equal access to the benefits of IT.

Nils Linhoff (Linhoff, 2023) emphasised that this post raises significant questions <br> 
about the role of military AI startups in today's business environment.

Constantinos Kyriacou (Kyriacou, 2023) pointed out that humanity must take full responsibility <br> 
for our behaviour and always ensure that our actions do not exceed predetermined limits.

In conclusion, I have not come across recent information from scholars regarding ethical issues in the use of AI in the military.<br> 
The most recent studies on this sensitive topic were published two to three years ago. <br> 
For example, "How viable is international arms control for military artificial intelligence? Three lessons from nuclear weapons" (Maas, 2019). <br> 
However, I believe this theme remains relevant, and scholars should raise more questions about it in the context of ethics.<br>
