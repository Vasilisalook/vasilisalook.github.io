I took a Data Visualisation course by an information designer Frederica Fragapane to represent any information more tidy and confident. <br>
My final project of the course represents the CO2 emissions by the most active 20 countries with a population of 5+ mln people during 19 years (2000-2019, with more details for 2019 year specifically). <br>
