## Knowledge that changes worldview
Before starting the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning module I had a very vague understanding of knowledge itself. 
I treated it mostly in a computer style: 1 – “I know” (the weather outside, 
number of my phone, my main aim for today, etc.) or 0 – “I do not know”. <br>
Sometimes I hesitated, for example, I asked myself “Do I know English?” or “Do I know Chinese?”, 
and the same about Polish or Russian languages that are my mother tongue. <br>
Every time I learn a specific language in depth, I realize that I have no idea on etymology, 
another context, or slang. Sometimes I confess to myself that I don't even know Russian, 
my first professional and native language. In this module I have learned that knowledge 
could be presented as myriads of connections between millions of concepts, 
and the connections even more important. <br>
Like Debenham (1988) said, knowledge is the explicit functional associations between items of information. 
So, when I am not able to explain some differences between related Polish and Russian languages 
(for example, why “beauty” in Polish – ‘uroda’ ¬– is literally “ugliness” in Russian), 
I just have not enough information and connections to etymology, or history. Unfortunately, 
in many cases linguists do not have these associations too. <br>
We live in a world where everyone has a little part of the ocean knowledge, we share some tiny points, 
however no one on Earth has the whole picture. On the other hand, we may consider 
knowledge as a gradient tissue with different connections densities. <br>
The question for the further discussion: is AI capable to be a champion of this density
over all humans what this could lead to? For sure. <br>
But do not be afraid: AI cannot exist without electricity; it has no critical thinking and its own central ideas so far.

## Ontology and anthology
My second discovery was ontology. Before the KRR module I knew what is anthology. 
According to the Oxford English dictionary, it is a published collection of poems or other pieces of writing. <br>
In computer science, ontology is a set of concepts that includes a description of concepts and the relationships between them (Parlar, 2019). 
I like this simple explanation of ontology, especially it is close to the knowledge definition itself. <br>
Similar to anthology I imagine ontology as a published collection too, however not of the poems, 
but concepts and associations between them. <br>
I am in love with structures, components, rules, links and relations, 
that is why the second assignment of the module seemed very interesting to me. <br>

![Protege](/assets/images/banners/protege.jpg 'A book description in Protege')

I created a project in Protégé for a tiny library in a small imaginary village. 
It has only 45 books and a dozen readers, however it was very useful to play with connections between the items, 
to work out a draft for the book rating system, etc. <br>
I found it very satisfying when the Reasoner provided the additional associations and outputs using elementary logics. 
For instance, about the “Animal Farm” book we directly added one piece of information about the rating. <br>
Nevertheless, the Reasoner gave 9 strings more, revealing data about the author, 
the person who has borrowed and rated the book, availability of the copy, 
based on the connections with different individuals and other concepts in ontology. 

## ChatGPT:  Gobbledygook, Piffle, Twaddle
I asked ChatGPT to find these three definitions. It is an incredibly useful language model, however, on the one hand,
it is just a big language model and nothing more. We still can relatively compare its engine with the T9 on smartphones, 
but a huge one. <br>
For instance, I inquired ChatGPT about myself shamelessly, however the output has zero level of the truth, 
in spite of the fact that my name is rare and there is only one journalist named like me, 
with the existing information on the open sources. <br>
Moreover, ChatGPT cannot solve elementary tasks, for example, 
I realize it is not able to write backwards the name of a famous soviet character “Cheburashka” – 
CharGPT transliterates the word from Cyrillic to Latin letters and back, resulting in extra letters and wrong letters order. <br>
On the other hand, thanks to ChatGPT I created a working code for my schedule. [The details are here.](https://vasilisalook.github.io/practice/2023/04/15/3-3.html)

## Ontology and language model
I took into account the tutor’s feedback for the first assignment of the module, 
and this time I would like to make parallels between ontology and language model.  <br>
Both of them are concerned with the nature of reality and the meaning of words and concepts. 
However, as Gruber (1993) noted that ontology is “a specification of a conceptualization”, 
its architecture designed by human, while language models like ChatGPT 
are trained on large datasets and do not require explicit human input for every step of operation. <br>
Also, ontology usually is built in some specific domain, for example, agriculture or medicine, 
whereas ChatGPT generates human-like responses. <br>
In summary, ontology and language models are both used for natural language processing,
but they have different purpose, design, and applications.

## AI and society
![The Sims](/assets/images/banners/sims.jpg 'The example of sims interaction')
Very interesting experiment has been published by Stanford/Google researchers 
a few days ago about generative agents on the simulation video game (Park at el., 2023). <br>
They created a virtual environment with 25 “sims” with some human-related abilities and the possibility 
to create a multilayered memory for each of them. Researchers waited for cringe results in the end, however, 
all the characters coordinate very well with each other and in a human-like way. <br>
Intelligent agents made gossip and flaked for the party. I used to play Sims when I was a child (and yesterday, frankly speaking). 
So, I personally waited for the moment when NPC in many games would exist not only like ontology, 
but also on the basis of language models and memory engines, going to be absolutely autonomous, natural and exciting. <br>
Additionally, I think, this research may help to create a safe environment to understand more about human society 
and the information tracking patterns in different cultures. <br>
In real life we have ethical and private boundaries with such experiments, 
however there is potential for further research in the virtual simulation world.

## Conclusion
As a journalist I was very enthusiastic about the KRR module. <br>
In my opinion, as much as the Machine Learning possibilities promise more benefits to biomedicine or manufacturing, 
the Knowledge and Ontology subjects fits better to social related topics. <br>
