## R Data Activities

**subset()** is my favourite function by far - if a table is huge, it allows to choose some segments from data by variables and research them deeply. So, for the dataset "Crime Survey for England and Wales (2013-2014)" I created the first subset for victims of a crime only, and then I used the second level of subsetting, working with victims of 75+ age.<br>
Or we can do it at once using logical operator & (Expl: > new_subset <- subset(data, status == "victim" **&** age > 75)<br>
**plot()** is my second handy function, it helps to visualise the data. Just a couple of observations: most crimes of that specific group 75+ are happened in urban area and they had been living there more than 20 years (may be there are more chances to be a victim if you are live such a long live and in the same place).
