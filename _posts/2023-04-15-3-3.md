## ChatGPT created a working code for my special schedule

 ![Handwritten calendar](/assets/images/banners/March2023.jpg)<br>
Like many people I have been trying ChatGPT for many ways, but I found it most useful for some coding tasks. <br>
Here is an example. <br>
I have got a special working schedule at my job - 3 work days and 3 days off and again 3 on, 3 off and so on. <br>
The second group of colleagues uses the same algorithm, but inversed scheme. So, the normal calendars<br>
with 5 "black" labor days and 2 "red" weekends don't work for us. <br>
Usually, I draw handmade calendars for myself each quarter during years to visualize, <br>
however sometimes I want to get the information quickly and for the distant date. <br>
That's why I need a program to ask about it. With the third attempt of the request's formulation <br>
ChatGPT gave me this code and I do feel comfortable using it, you are welcome to check it.<br>
