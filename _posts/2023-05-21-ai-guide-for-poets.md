## Everyone can be an artist 

 ![AIGuide](/assets/images/banners/AIGuide.png)<br>

I have compiled [a simple guide](https://github.com/Vasilisalook/vasilisalook.github.io/blob/main/AI-Illustration%20for%20Poets.pdf), 
based on Midjourney, to assist poets in becoming painters with AI, 
even if they have never heard of Machine Learning or mistakenly believe 
that CNN refers to a television channel rather than Convolutional Neural Network. 
(If you download the file onto your PC, the links will become active).
I would be delighted if you find it useful.
